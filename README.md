# Project Details

## *Thesis:*

This project aims to explore the relationship between various business attributes and review ratings. We hypothesize that certain business attributes (e.g., reviews, location, service quality, etc.) can be used to train AI to analyze and make suggestions to improve the businesses.

---

## Data

To prepare our sentiment analysis model, we leveraged the __[Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)__ to harness existing reviews and ratings. These datasets cover aspects such as business information, customer check-ins, reviews, tips, and user data.

### Methods
Data Management with gdown due to the large size of the training files required for our models, alternative storage solutions to Git were necessary as a result of storage limits. We selected `gdown` for its integration with Google Drive.

The notebook `json_conversion_for_gdown.ipynb` serves to convert our source files and test functions for retrieval from Google Drive. After successful tests, the relevant code was integrated into our main working notebooks. This notebook is retained in Resources/ for reference.

This project includes multiple components such as data fetching, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data integration, BERT-based Models, web scraping, LangChain, and OpenAI:
- **Data Fetching: Automated scripts to download data from Google Drive.**
- **EDA: Scripts for performing initial exploratory data analysis on the fetched data.**
- **Sentiment Analysis Using BERT-based Models: Use trained model on test dataset to predict sentiments**
- **Universal Business Review Sentiment Analysis**
- **Review Scraping: Scripts to scrape reviews and other details from Google Maps using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.**
- **Apply the Sentiment Analysis Model to the Web Scrapped Data**
- **se Reviews from Selected Business to run ChatGPT Model**
- **Spooder Ap**

### Instructions for Running the Code:
1.  Clone repository to a local directory.
2.  Ensure necessary API Keys are present in your local `.env`.
3.  Uncomment neccesary `pip install`s as needed from `[notebook]`.
4.  If executing for the first time, uncomment any `gdown` fetch cells and comment out their corresponding `.csv` read ins.
If, however, you are executing the notebook any subsequent time, comment out all instances of `gdown` fetch requests, and instead utilize their corresponding `.csv` read ins.
5.  `Run All Cells` to execute the code in every cell of the notebook in sequence. Alternatively, each cell may be `Run` on its own, though it is still recommended to run them in order.  *Note: This will launch the application* `SpooderApp™` *in your default browser.*
6.  Consult onscreen guide in `SpooderApp™` interface for use.

## Fetching Data:

### User Defined Functions:
*declared in this section*
| **Function** | *Details* |
| :--- | :--- |
| `fetch_data(set)` | Downloads and reads datasets into DataFrames |

Use the provided scripts to download datasets from Google Drive. Alternatively, the data can be directly download from https://www.yelp.com/dataset and processed, dependent on the user's computing power and graphic card. Uncomment appropriate code if datasets are download directly. The 5 datasets from Yelp contain Business dataset, Checkin dataset, Reviews dataset, Tips dataset, and User dataset.

## Performing EDA:

Analyze the data to uncover insights and prepare for further processing.
    We began by loading and examining the following datasets:
- **Business Dataset**: Contains business data including location data, attributes, and categories.
- **Checkin Dataset**: Contains check-in data on businesses (not used in final analysis due to low relevance).
- **Reviews Dataset**: Contains full review text data, along with user and business identifiers.
- **Tips Dataset**: Contains shorter user recommendations on businesses (merged with reviews for analysis).
- **User Dataset**: Contains user data, including friend mappings and metadata (excluded to preserve anonymity).

The data was preprocessed by removing irrelevant columns, renaming variables, and merging relevant datasets for further analysis.  The final merged dataset prepared for machine learning included business id, stars, for rating purposes, review text for NLP tasks, stars average ratings, and other relevant buiness metadata.

This portion of the application is designed to perform sentiment analysis on business reviews. It classifies reviews into positive, neutral or negative and provides confidence scoress for each classification. While trained on Yelp! data, and developed for Google Reviews, the goal of the application is to be as univerally applicable to business reviews as possible - regardless of the source. Though our initial attempt to train our model yielded an accruacy of only around forty-five percemt (~40%), through hypertuning we achieved an accuracy over eighty percent (80%).

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using a fine-tuned, pre-trained model nick named `roberto` to analyze sentiment of reviews and assigns a sentiment lable of positive, neutral, or negative.
- **Data Aggregation**: Functions designed to retrieve and process business names and reviews from a dataset.
- **Sentiment Summary**: Classify sentiment for a business based on all availabe reviews.

Sentiment Analysis Using BERT-based Models:

 - **Data Sampling and Preparation**: The dataset was balanced by sampling Yelp reviews based on their star ratings.
 - **Test Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing text data for modal processing.
 - **Model Training**: Pre-trained DistilBERT model for sentiment classification.
 - **Evaluation**: Use metrics accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.
 - **Model Deployment**: Use trained model, `roberto`, on test dataset to predict sentiments.

Star ratings were encoded into 3 categories using label encoding. 
-	0 for negative (1, 2 stars)
-	1 for neutral (3 stars)
-	2 for positive (4, 5 stars)

Sample Evaluation Metrics:
-	Accuracy: 0.8169
-	Precision: 0.8175
-	Recall: 0.8169
-	F1 Score: 0.8171

Utilize Selenium to scrape reviews from specified Google Maps URLs ChromeDriver must be installed on your system to run the web scraping for business information, along with pandas, selenium, and beautifulsoup4.

This is a Python-based web scraper designed to extract business details and customer reviews from Google Maps using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The scraper navigates through multiple Google Maps URLs, collects business information such as names, ratings, addresses, and retrieves customer reviews. The extracted data is then organized into a structured format for further analysis.

Script functions:
- **Setup WebDriver**: Initalizes a Selenium Web to interact with web pages.
- **Navigate and Extract Data**: Accesses specific URLs to extract business details such as business name, average rating, and business address. Captures and parses customer reviews, text and ratings into a DataFrame.
- **Data Handling**: Organizes and stores the extracted data in a structured format using pandas. 
- **Automated Scrolling and Clicks**: Simulates user interction for loading more reviews.

The code applies sentiment analysis to Google Reviews data and processes the results to calculate the overall sentiment of a business and compile a list of its reviews. This processed data can then be used for further analysis, reporting, or input into other models, such as generating responses or insights using an OpenAI LangChain we nicknamed `davidlingo`.

- **Applies Sentiment Analysis**: Uses a sentiment analysis model to analyze the sentiment of each review in the scraped data.
- **Calculates Overall Sentiment**: Aggregates the sentiment analysis results to determine the overall sentiment for specific businesses. This provides a general sentiment score or label that represents the business's customer feedback.
- **Compiles Reviews**: Collects all reviews for a specific business into a list, which can be used for further analysis, reporting, or as input for other models, such as generating responses or insights.

Then a OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model is used to analyze customer reviews and generate a summary along with actionable recommendations for improving a business.

- **Load Environment and Initialize Model**: Sets up the OpenAI API and initializes the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- **Generate Prompt**: Creates a prompt template to instruct the model to summarize reviews and suggest improvements.
- **Runs the Language Model Chain**: Uses the LLMChain model to generate a summary and recommendations based on the provided reviews.
- **Extract and Display Results**: Extracts the summary and recommendations from the model's output and prints them to the console.

## Future Considerations

If more time allowed, future enhancements may consist of the following:
- We can consider expanding the model to handle reviews in multiple languages (M-Bert), reflecting Yelp's diverse global user base, which would make our application more versatile and accessible.
- We can also integrate predictive models to forecast future review trends or business performance based on current sentiment scores and other variables like location or time of year. 
- Developing customizable dashboards where businesses can track their reviews and sentiment trends over time. Improving the interactivity of the web application with features like voice commands or chatbots that could guide users through the data exploration process.
- Allow for ad hoc searches of businesses and real-time web scraping.
- Retrieve a complete list of available reviews in lieu of the sampled up-to-fifty.
- Train roberto on a larger dataset than the six thousand (6,000) reviews provided.
- Final application to be deployed to a web server, making it accessible for real-world use.
